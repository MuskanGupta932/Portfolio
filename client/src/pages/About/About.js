                Hello! I'm Muskan Gupta, an enthusiastic undergraduate pursuing my Bachelor of Technology at NIT Delhi. Born and brought up in the vibrant city of Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh, I’ve always been fascinated by the limitless possibilities that technology offers. My journey into the world of tech began with a spark of curiosity, which soon evolved into a deep passion for coding, web development, and the transformative power of machine learning and deep learning.

As a tech enthusiast, I love exploring how innovative ideas can be brought to life through code. Whether it’s building intuitive web interfaces, solving real-world problems with algorithms, or diving into the complexities of artificial intelligence, I thrive on the excitement of learning and creating. I believe in continuous growth and constantly push myself to explore new tools, frameworks, and emerging technologies.
